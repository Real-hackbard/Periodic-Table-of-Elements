The Periodic Table is a chart that organizes all known Chemical Elements by increasing [Atomic Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number) (number of protons), with Elements arranged in rows ([periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(periodic_table))) and columns (groups) that reveal trends in their Chemical and Physical Properties. Created by [Dmitri Mendeleev](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Iwanowitsch_Mendelejew) in the mid-19th century, the table provides essential information such as an element's symbol, atomic mass, and electron configuration, helping scientists to understand and predict their behavior.

The first periodic table to become generally accepted was that of the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869; he formulated the periodic law as a dependence of chemical properties on [atomic mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass). As not all elements were then known, there were gaps in his periodic table, and Mendeleev successfully used the periodic law to [predict some properties of some of the missing elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendeleev%27s_predicted_elements). The periodic law was recognized as a fundamental discovery in the late 19th century. It was explained early in the 20th century, with the discovery of atomic numbers and associated pioneering work in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics), both ideas serving to illuminate the internal structure of the atom. A recognisably modern form of the table was reached in 1945 with [Glenn T. Seaborg's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_T._Seaborg) discovery that the [actinides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinide) were in fact f-block rather than d-block elements. The periodic table and law have become a central and indispensable part of modern chemistry.

### Key Aspects of the Periodic Table:
* Organization by Atomic Number: Elements are arranged from left to right and top to bottom in order of increasing atomic number. 
* Periods (Rows): Horizontal rows on the table are called periods. 
* Groups (Columns): Vertical columns are known as groups. Elements in the same group share similar chemical properties. 
* Recurring Properties (Periodicity): The table's structure highlights chemical periodicity, meaning that elements show recurring patterns in their properties. 
* 118 Known Elements: The modern periodic table includes all 118 currently known elements, from hydrogen (atomic number 1) to oganesson (atomic number 118). 
* Key Information: Each element's cell contains its symbol (e.g., H for Hydrogen), atomic number, and atomic mass, along with other details like electron configuration and electronegativity.

### History and Creation:
* Dmitri Mendeleev: The periodic table is largely credited to Dmitri Mendeleev, who published his first version in 1869. 
* Evolution: The table has evolved over the past 150 years, reflecting scientific development and understanding in chemistry and physics. 
* Current Management: [The International Union](https://iupac.org/what-we-do/periodic-table-of-elements/) of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is responsible for managing the periodic table and setting criteria for the discovery and naming of new elements.

### Uses of the Periodic Table:
* Quick Reference: Scientists use the periodic table to quickly find information about an element. 
* Predicting Trends: The table helps to discern trends in properties such as electronegativity, ionization energy, and atomic radius. 
* Understanding Element Behavior: Its organization allows scientists to understand an element's structure and its potential to form bonds with other elements.
